Based on what classes you added, you can pick which class you need a tutor for.
Let's say we need help with MATH:

After clicking on the class you need help with, a list of tutors who have previously taken that exact same class will appear.

Let's say you need to get a hold of a tutor ASAP like Persona "Trey".
Let's click on the first tutor who is available NOW !

By clicking the tutors who are available NOW, TutorMe will automatically start calling the tutor.
This feature allows users a quick and effecient way to contacting someone to help you 
because you don't waste time
* Trying to get a hold of a tutor
* And setting up a time and place to meet.

Once the call ends, you're profile/account will show.
The three lines on the upper right corner are all the options you have.

If instead of picking a tutor who is available NOW, 
you wanted to meet with a tutor the next day right before an exam/quiz,
You can do that also:
