According to our pie charts, majority of our survey takers are young adults who are graduating from college soon who mostly have GPA’s ranging from 2.1-3.0 And prefer to pay $0 for tutoring services.

Our bar charts indicate that the majority of our users prefer to be tutored individually plus they don’t have enough time to look for a tutor when needed.

Our suggestions responses dictate that users want a quick and efficient way to finding a tutor without doing too much.

## Conclusions

TutorMe should be an app where users sign in and according to their major and what classes they are currently taking, All available tutors on campus will pop up with the time slots in which they are free. 

By making TutorMe an App, users will use less of their time searching for a tutor, instead they’d be able to click on the app, click on the class they need help in, and boom all available tutors will show up. Not only is this App free, but it will match you with tutors who have already taken the class you’re struggling with.

These implementations are based on our suggestion responses.

## Caveats

Because our sample size was not large enough to include students from other backgrounds/majors, TutorMe may not develop its full potential to being revolutionary.

# Personas

Persona 1: Trey

Trey is a full-time student and works part-time on campus. He never really has free time unless if its the weekend. He is a senior at Chico State and cares about finishing with a strong GPA. 

Because Trey is too busy with school and work Monday - Friday from 8AM-5PM, he has difficulty in finding help for his classes. Most of his classmates are no longer on campus by the time he’s free and really needs that person to person tutoring session in order to get the help he needs.

## Scenarios

Trey has an exam in 2 days and needs further assistance with understanding some concepts before the test. He is unable to go to office hours because of schedule conflicts between school and work. He only has time after 6pm. He needs to find a tutor ASAP to help him get his questions answered.
